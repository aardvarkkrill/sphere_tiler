How to make the bagel.png tile.

This isn't the only way to do it, but it's the method I used.
Take 400g of active sourdough starter (i.e. 200g strong wholemeal bread flour, 
200g water, that has been working on your starter culture for a while)
and add 400g strong white bread flour and 400g of strong wholemeal bread flour.
(You can vary the proportions, but it gets quite heavy if you don't have any
white flour in there.)  Add 16g of ordinary salt, and 400g of water.  Mix well,
knead/stretch it a bit, wet the top, cover and leave for a few hours.  Stretch
it a bit more.  Wait a bit more.  See that it has puffed up a bit (but it won't
be much, and it doesn't matter.)  

Divide into 12 equal pieces and roll each piece into a sausage
(about 15cm long) and then join the ends by overlapping a couple of cm and 
gently rolling that bit some more to make them stick.  Put them on a floured,
non-stick baking sheet, cover with a slightly damp cloth and put in the fridge
overnight to prove.  (Instead, if you start in the morning, you can leave them
for a few hours in the kitchen to prove.)
 
They need to puff up a little, but don't let them over-prove.  If they start
getting soft, they will break apart in the next step.

Preheat the oven to 220 degrees Celsius.

Coat each bagel on the top with a little olive oil.

Boil a wide pan of water 4cm deep (or more -- deep enough for the dough to float
in without sticking to the bottome) and add a teaspoon of baking powder. Put the
bagels in a few at a time (they shouldn't touch each other) boil for 30 seconds
on each side and put them on a wire rack.  While the next batch boil you can
dip one side of the draining bagels in a plate of dark poppy seeds.  You could
use sesame seeds too.  When coated, put them on parchment paper on baking sheets
and bake immediately at 220 degrees Celsius for about 15 minutes, turn them over
and do a couple more minutes to dry them off underneath.  Don't over-cook them
as you want them to be soft. 

Take them out of the oven and cool them on a wire rack.

Before you split them, and smother them in cream cheese with smoked salmon, 
fresh dill, lemon juice and black pepper, don't forget to take a photograph
of one to make a tile image.  Set all the background to transparent, and save
as a .png file.
